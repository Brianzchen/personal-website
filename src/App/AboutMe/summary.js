  I'm a self-taught and self-motivated JavaScript developer, passionate about the front-end world, always striving for improvement and a strong believer that if you want to improve, you need a personal project.

  Experienced ReactJS + Redux developer with strong CSS3 skills. Confident in turning any design into an interactive page.
  Have experience being the lead developer in creating a company in-house ReactJS-based GUI framework, that focuses on performance and cross-browser support.

  I'm a forward thinker who is always looking at ways to improve the current process, from experimenting with running an agile scrum retrospective in an action-oriented way, to transitioning a company's JavaScript development from global scoped ECMAScript 5 to modern moduled ECMAScript 6+.

  I want to be part of a project that is useful to those around me, to see my contributions in use and be proud that I helped to create it.

  In my free time I like to work on my personal projects, go to the gym and watch YouTube.

  I also love agile and a damn good user experience.
