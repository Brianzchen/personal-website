  Kiwiplan is a company I started working for in July 2016. Since then I have taken my knowledge of web development to improve the company as best I can.

  In December of 2016, I explored the possibility of updating the companies current suite of web products to ReactJS. Through this, the companies newer products now run on a modern set of front-end processes.
  The products use ES2015+ with ReactJS + Redux and is compiled through babel with Webpack. Navigation while previously handled by HTML location changes were updated to use client side routing with react-router to allow for smooth transitions and state retention to allow for smaller network payloads on page changes.

  I also implemented an on site npm server where I host the an inhouse React based gui framework that I created and currently maintain.
