  Kiwiplan is a company I started working at in July 2016. Since then I have taken my knowledge of web development to improve the company the best I can.

  In December of 2016, I explored the possibility of updating the companies current suite of web products to ReactJS. Through this, the company's newer products now run on a modern set of front-end processes.
  The products use ES2015+ with ReactJS + Redux and is compiled through Babel with Webpack. Navigation, while previously handled by HTML location changes, were updated to use client-side routing with react-router to allow smooth transitions and state retention which facilitates smaller network payloads on page changes.

  I also implemented an on-site npm server where I host an inhouse React-based GUI framework that I created and maintain.
