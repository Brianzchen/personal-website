  I'm the kind of guy gets started on something and then somehow loses track of time. Commonly when on the computer either playing a video game or coding.

  So I decided why not take this opportunity to build something to solve my own problems. The idea of this app is, you choose one or a few YouTube videos and you then set a timer for a set amount of time (I typically do one hour). Once that time is over, the videos will play to indicate it's time for a break. And when it's over, the timer will restart and you can get back to your fun.

  This app has gone through many iterations as I've evolved my development skills, from an Angular 1.X app, then vanilla ReactJS and now in its hopefully final form, a ReactJS + Redux app.
