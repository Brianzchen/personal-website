  I'm a huge advocate of personal projects. I believe it's the best way to learn, the best way to improve. If you want to get better, why not do so while creating something you'll use, that way you'll push yourself.
  If you find something too difficult to implement you'll force yourself to make it happen because you are the consumer and you know how killer that feature is, and when it's done you will have learnt something new.

  Dhax is my attempt at a personal project at scale. It's not intended to be groundbreaking or super innovative. But to be something that I can work on, to improve personally, to know that I built it's all myself. While also being something that I would personally use on a daily basis instead being a simple app 'hello world' app I build for the sake of building it.

  This project is all about helping me decide where to eat. Have you ever had that feeling where you can't quite decide where to eat? You know all the restaurants in your area that you like but you simply can't pick one or you think you may have forgotten one. Why not let an app decide for you?
