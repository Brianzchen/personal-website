  I'm a huge advocate of personal projects; I believe it's the best way to learn, the best way to improve. If you want to get better, why not do so by creating something you'll use, that way you'll be more motivated to complete it.
  If you find something that's difficult to implement, you'll force yourself to make it happen because you are the consumer and you know how killer that feature is, and when it's done you will have learnt something new.

  Dhax is my attempt to create a personal project at scale. It's not intended to be groundbreaking or super innovative, but to be something that I can work on, to improve personally, to know that I built it all myself. At the same time, to serve as something that I would personally use on a daily basis instead being a simple "hello world" app I built for the sake of building it.

  Have you ever had that feeling where you can't quite decide where to eat? You know all the restaurants in your area that you like but you simply can't pick one or you think you may have forgotten one. Why not let an app decide for you? That's what Dhax does for you.
